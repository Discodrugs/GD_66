script vs programming
script can be shared and understood by others 
programming is compiled into 1's and 0's 


javascript is used in every browser
little relation to java 
* javascript issues commands to structure
* a chain of events
* common events are mouse clicks on a dropdown menu, window resizing, 
  for example.
  These events create functions. think domino effect.

* a synchronous language
  relies on previous line of script to function
  javascript trumps html

  Function <-- Command 

  variables
 (think of it as a container)
  Boolean. has two states, positive or negative, yes or no. up or down.
  float
  string. a line of text
  integer
